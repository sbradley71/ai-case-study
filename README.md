# Siemens AI for Industrial Control Systems

## Overview and Origin

* **_Siemens & Halske_** was founded in 1847 by Werner von Siemens and Johann Georg Halske based on the telegraph with their invention using a needle to point to the sequence of instead of using morse code.  **_Siemens AG_** was founded in 1966 with the mergers of **_Siemens & Halske, Siemens-Schuckert and Siemens-Reiniger-Werke_**.

* Siemens is currently the largest industrial manufacturing company in Europe, and holds the position of global market leader in industrial automation and industrial software.


* Siemens has raised a total of $5.2 billion in funding over 2 rounds.  Siemens is funded by the US Department of Energy.

## Business Activities

* Siemens is making the workforce more efficient by generating automation, such as Programmable Logic Controllers, code with natural language input.  An example of generative AI is Siemens Industrial Copilot.

* Siemens is reducing machine downtime by finding and fixing errors using Siemens Industrial Copilot.  Siemens Industrial Copilot has access to all relevant documentation, guideline, and manuals to assist shopfloor workers with identifying possible errors.  This Copilot also enable humans to speak to machines in our language.  The Copilot will make human-machine interactions faster, more intuitive and more efficient.

* Siemens has a neural processing unit module for the Simatic S7-1500 controller and the ET 200MP I/O system which enables machine to recognize complex patterns.

* The company's intended customers utilize industrial control systems to control and optimize production processes.  The global Industrial Control Systems AI market was estimated at USD 185.27 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 283.76 billion by 2029.

* Siemens competitive advantage for AI for Industrial Control systems lies in its deep domain expertise, comprehensive product portfolio, cloud-based IoT platform (MindSphere), tailored AI algorithms, edge computing capabilities, cybersecurity focus, collaborations, and legacy system  integration expertise.


## Landscape

* Siemens is in the field of industrial control systems.

> * "In the realm of industrial control systems (ICS), Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed significant advancements over the past five years. Some of the major trends are:
> 
> * Flexibility and Sustainability: Manufacturing systems are increasingly emphasizing flexibility and sustainability. AI methods are being harnessed to address these challenges while maintaining and enhancing production capacities and productivity. The complexity of production systems has grown, necessitating more sophisticated control algorithms and solutions1.
> * AI at Various Levels: AI-based approaches are now explored across different levels of industrial control systems:
 >   * Sensor Fusion Methods: AI aids in fusing data from various sensors, enhancing situational awareness.
 >   * Model Predictive Control Techniques: Novel AI-driven control strategies optimize real-time control of complex machines and production processes.
 >   * Self-Optimizing Machines: AI enables machines to adapt and optimize their performance autonomously.
 >   * Collaborative Robots: AI facilitates safe and efficient collaboration between robots and human workers.
 >   * Autonomous Vehicles in Warehouses: AI-controlled autonomous vehicles navigate warehouses, transport goods, and optimize material handling.
 >   * Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs): AI enhances user interfaces for operators and engineers. Natural language processing and gesture recognition improve communication and control.
>
>* These examples demonstrate how AI is transforming industrial processes, making them more efficient, adaptive, and intelligent. The field continues to evolve, with ongoing research and practical implementations."

* Major competitors of Siemens for Artificial Intelligence in Industrial Control Systems are Intrinsic, Rockwell Automation, Teradyne, Matthews International and Omron Robotics and Safety Technologies.

## Results

* Siemens has products such as Mindsphere, Simatic S7-1500, Simatic S7-1200 and Simatic Edge with integrate Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) with AI to help improve industrial automation, enable predictive maintenance and optimize industrial processes.
* Companies involved in AI for ICS consider accuracy and robustness, bias detection and mitigation, interpretability and explainability, safety and security, efficiency and resource utilization, adapabilty and generalization, and real-world impact as measures for success.  

* In 2022, Siemens dominated the distributed contol systems market with over 36.2% revenue share.

## Recommendations

* I recommend Siemens to develop a product that can extract information from Process and Instrumentation diagrams, Microsoft Office tools such as Word and Excel, and pdfs to gather information and develop a plc program in their product language.  This would give customers amazing capability to reduce their control system programming time and reduce programming errors.  It would be an extremely marketable offering.  System integrators typically charge 1 hour per disceet I/O point and 10 hours per analog point at an average hourly rate of $60 per hour.

* This product would use CAD data extraction automation and Microsoft Office and pdf data mining software to get the requirements needed for the PLC program.
